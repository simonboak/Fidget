Fidget - Add multi-touch gestures to your mobile site or web app

Fidget is a jQuery plugin that makes it easy to add multi-touch gesture 
recognition to your mobile site and web apps.

It uses the Touch Event object in Mobile WebKit on both iOS and the later 
versions of Android. Use Fidget to detect when a multi-touch gesture is 
performed on a DOM element and can drag or scale those elements. You also 
get a Fidget event object to help build multi-touch interfaces.
